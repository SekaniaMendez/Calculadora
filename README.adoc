== Overview
This project implements a cross-platform calculator using **C++** and **Qt Widgets**.
It provides a graphical user interface (`UICalculator`) and a calculation engine
(`Engine`) separated into distinct modules for clarity and maintainability.

[NOTE]
====
This calculator has been tested successfully on **macOS (Apple Silicon)**, **Ubuntu 22.04**, and **Windows 11**, ensuring full cross‑platform compatibility.

== Documentation

This project uses Doxygen for documentation.  

*macOS*::
- Install Homebrew if not installed: https://brew.sh/
- Install Doxygen and Graphviz:
  ```bash
  brew install doxygen graphviz
  ```
*Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)*::
- Update packages and install:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
  ```

=== How to generate the documentation
doxygen Doxyfile
The documentation will be generated in the `docs/html` folder.  
To view it, open:
- macOS: `open docs/html/index.html`
- Linux: `xdg-open docs/html/index.html`
- Windows: Double-click `docs/html/index.html`

*Windows*::
- Download and install Doxygen: https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html
- (Optional) Install Graphviz: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html
- Ensure `doxygen.exe` is added to the PATH.

== Features
* **Basic arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Base conversion
** A single **Convert** button is available instead of separate Hex/Oct/Dec buttons.
** Pressing **Convert** opens a new window where the current number is shown in:
*** Binary
*** Hexadecimal
*** Octal
*** One's complement
*** Two's complement (with minimal bit-length representation).

* **Random number generation**: Produces a random integer (0–999999).
* **Keyboard input support**:
** Digits (0–9)
** Operators (+, −, ×, ÷)
** Equals (= or Enter)
** Escape (clear)
** Backspace (delete one character)
* **Chained operations**: Allows evaluating expressions step by step, just like
a handheld calculator.
* **UI built with Qt**:
** Digit buttons (0–9)
** Operator buttons (+, −, ×, ÷, =)
** Utility buttons (Clear, Back, CE)
** Base conversion buttons (Dec, Hex, Oct, Bin)
** Random (Rnd) button with optional maximum value input (default 0–999999)

== Project Structure
* `src/engine.h` / `src/engine.cpp` ::
  Core calculation engine. Holds operands, operator, and provides arithmetic and
  conversion operations.
* `src/UICalculator.h` / `src/UICalculator.cpp` ::
  Main UI window implemented with Qt Widgets. Manages layout, display, buttons,
  and connects them to the engine.
* `src/main.cpp` ::
  Application entry point. Initializes Qt, constructs and shows the calculator
  window, and starts the event loop.

== Build Instructions

=== Prerequisites
* CMake (>=3.15 recommended)
* C++17 capable compiler
* Qt6 (Widgets module)
* Visual Studio Code with extensions:
** *CMake Tools*
** *C/C++* (Microsoft)
** (Optional) *Qt VS Tools* if you want better Qt integration

=== macOS (with Homebrew)
[source,shell]
----
brew install cmake qt
----

=== Linux (Ubuntu/Debian example)
[source,shell]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev
----

=== Windows
1. Install **CMake** (https://cmake.org/download/).
2. Install **Qt6** (via the Qt Online Installer).
3. Install **Visual Studio 2022** (Community edition is enough) with *Desktop development with C++* workload.
4. In VS Code, make sure you have the *CMake Tools* and *C/C++* extensions enabled.

=== Build
[source,shell]
----
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
----

=== Run
[source,shell]
----
./build/calculator
----
*Note:* On Windows the executable will be `build\\Debug\\calculator.exe` or `build\\Release\\calculator.exe` depending on configuration.

== Usage
* Launch the application.
* Enter numbers using either the digit buttons or the keyboard.
* Press an operator (+, −, ×, ÷) to set the operation.
* Enter the second number and press `=` (or Enter key) to evaluate.
* Use convert to transform the current number to `Dec`, `Hex`, `Oct`, and `Bin`, also gives the complements.
* Use `Random` to generate a random number.
* Use the box next to random to set the maximum number for the random function.

* Use `Clear` to reset the calculator or `Back` to remove the last character.

== Video Demostration
The following video demonstrates the calculator in action and what you will see in the debug window
